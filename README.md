- [Soft Skills Matter Now More Than Ever](https://hbr.org/2025/08/soft-skills-matter-now-more-than-ever-according-to-new-research?ab=HP-hero-for-you-1) — As AI continues to improve and replaces more and more lower-level tasks in industries like Software Engineering and Consulting, entry-level employees are increasingly going to need to think bigger picture, collaborate with others, and coordinate new and various systems. In the past, companies could get away with screening for leadership ability after fulfilling all of their entry-level positions, with the best and brightest rising to the top, but now they must make sure that even their early talent understands the business is able to lead small initiatives- even if just with AI workers working for them. We can already see this reflected in companies' increasing AI use, screening for talent with AI interest/skills, and reducing the number of new hires. In such a fast-moving landscape, the companies that succeed will be the ones that up-skill their current workforce in terms of AI and business literacy and screen for leadership talent from an early stage, increasing ownership throughout the company leading to more innovation and new ideas.

## Books
- [The Undoing Project](https://www.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds/dp/0393254593) — It is hard to read academic psychology literature, so this was a great way to learn about some of the most ground-breaking research done on our brains through the lens of a story. The work done by Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky is somewhat like watching an early sitcom, many of the punchlines have been replicated in years since and may seem like old news, but it is hard to overemphasize the importance of their work and one must be hyper-vigilant when understanding the faults of the human mind as they come so natural to us. This book reinforced my respect for data-driven decision making. It is also worth noting how important the partnership between Danny and Amos was and how key connections that make up for each other's losses can be key to success in life. It is still hard to internalize some of the key lessons in this book, but hopefully it will at some point make whoever reads it do a double-take when making a decision that has to do with economics, psychology, or statistics.

- [Three Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032) — Fascinating book that combines existential science fiction topics with history, war, technology, and politics. Kind of hard to keep up with some of the super scientific and historical bits but the overall theme of corruption and humanity's reliance on faith in humanity is really interesting.

- [Shoe Dog](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike/dp/1501135910) — One of the greatest entrepreneurial books of all time- takeaways included that one keen insight can turn into something much greater if you have the discipline and passion to follow the thread. Phil Knight took the lessons he learned as a runner and applied them directly to his business. The hardest part is starting, taking the risk, going for the run, etc., and mistakes are not just common along the way they are the norm. Knight was flawed in many ways, unsure of himself and not a natural leader on paper, and yet he proved that his shortcomings could be overcome with consistent effort and a clear vision for the future, relying on those around him when needed. Nothing great is ever accomplished alone, and even the biggest businesses were at one point built one phone call at a time.
