## Books

- [Three Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032) — Fascinating book that combines existential science fiction topics with history, war, technology, and politics. Kind of hard to keep up with some of the super scientific and historical bits but the overall theme of corruption and humanity's reliance on faith in humanity is really interesting.

- [Shoe Dog](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike/dp/1501135910) — One of the greatest entrepreneurial books of all time- takeaways included that one keen insight can turn into something much greater if you have the discipline and passion to follow the thread. Phil Knight took the lessons he learned as a runner and applied them directly to his business. The hardest part is starting, taking the risk, going for the run, etc., and mistakes are not just common along the way they are the norm. Knight was flawed in many ways, unsure of himself and not a natural leader on paper, and yet he proved that his shortcomings could be overcome with consistent effort and a clear vision for the future, relying on those around him when needed. Nothing great is ever accomplished alone, and even the biggest businesses were at one point built one phone call at a time.
